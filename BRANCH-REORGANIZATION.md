# üèóÔ∏è Repository Branch Reorganization

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive reorganization of the Free Deep Research repository from 12 branches to a professional 3-branch structure following Git Flow best practices.

## Previous Branch Structure (12 Branches)

### Feature Branches
1. **feature/bmad-research-integration** - BMAD AI Agent integration
2. **feature/v3.0.0-global-intelligence-network** - Version 3.0.0 features  
3. **feature/intelligent-port-management-system** - Docker port management
4. **feature/docker-containerization-v3.0.0** - Docker containerization
5. **feature/comprehensive-audit-and-fixes** - System audit and fixes
6. **feature/comprehensive-audit-fixes** - Duplicate audit fixes
7. **feature/repository-reorganization-professional-structure** - Structure improvements

### Fix Branches
8. **fix/rebuild-readme-with-working-links** - Documentation fixes

### Update Branches  
9. **update/readme-version-2.1.0** - README updates

### Phase Branches
10. **phase-1-critical-fixes** - Critical system fixes
11. **phase-4-advanced-features** - Advanced ML and analytics features

### Main Branch
12. **main** - Primary development branch

## New Professional Structure (3 Branches)

### 1. `main` (Production/Stable)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready, stable code
- **Content**: Fully tested, reviewed, and approved features
- **Protection**: Protected with required reviews
- **Merge Policy**: Only from `develop` via Pull Request

### 2. `develop` (Development/Integration)  
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for ongoing development
- **Content**: Stable development features ready for testing
- **Protection**: Moderate protection, automated testing required
- **Merge Policy**: From `feature-staging` and feature branches

### 3. `feature-staging` (Feature Development/Experimental)
- **Purpose**: Active feature development and experimentation
- **Content**: Work-in-progress features, experimental code
- **Protection**: Minimal protection, allows rapid iteration
- **Merge Policy**: Direct commits and feature branch merges

| fix/rebuild-readme-with-working-links | ‚úÖ Merged | main | Ready for cleanup |
| update/readme-version-2.1.0 | ‚úÖ Merged | main | Ready for cleanup |
| phase-1-critical-fixes | ‚úÖ Merged | main | Ready for cleanup |
| phase-4-advanced-features | ‚úÖ Merged | main | Ready for cleanup |
| main | ‚úÖ Active | - | Production branch |

## New Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `feature-staging`
2. Develop and test feature
3. Merge to `feature-staging` for integration
4. When stable, merge to `develop`
5. After testing, merge to `main` via PR

### Hotfixes
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Fix critical issue
3. Merge back to `main` and `develop`

### Releases
1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Final testing and bug fixes
3. Merge to `main` and tag release
4. Merge back to `develop`

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Simplified Management
- Only 3 branches to maintain vs 12
- Clear purpose for each branch
- Reduced complexity and confusion

### ‚úÖ Professional Standards
- Follows Git Flow best practices
- Industry-standard workflow
- Enterprise-ready structure

### ‚úÖ Preserved History
