## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Initialize the Orchestrator**
   ```
   Load the orchestrator and select your workflow mode
   ```

2. **Choose Your Mode**
   - **Documentation Mode**: Generate complete project documentation
   - **Full Development Mode**: Interactive development with AI agents

3. **Select Specialist Agent**
   - Product Manager (John) - Requirements and PRDs
   - Architect (Fred) - Technical design and architecture
   - Developer (Alex) - Implementation and coding
   - Platform Engineer (Alex) - Infrastructure and DevOps

### Example Workflow

```
User: "I need to create a PRD for a new mobile app"
Orchestrator: "This requires our Product Manager specialist. Switching to John..."
John (PM): "I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD. Let me gather requirements..."
```
