# Error Handling and Recovery Procedures

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive error handling procedures for the AI Agent Orchestrator system. All error conditions should be handled gracefully with clear, actionable error messages and appropriate recovery procedures.

## Error Categories

### 1. Configuration Errors

**Configuration File Missing**
- **Error**: Agent configuration file not found
- **Message**: "Configuration file 'config/agents.yaml' not found. Please ensure the configuration file exists and is accessible."
- **Recovery**: Prompt user to check file path or provide alternative configuration location
- **Fallback**: Operate in basic mode with limited agent capabilities

**Configuration Validation Errors**
- **Error**: Configuration file fails schema validation
- **Message**: "Configuration validation failed: [specific validation error]. Please review the configuration file and correct the identified issues."
- **Recovery**: Provide specific line numbers and validation errors
- **Fallback**: Load with default configuration where possible

**Agent Definition Errors**
- **Error**: Agent persona file missing or invalid
- **Message**: "Agent persona file 'agents/[agent]/persona.md' not found or invalid. Agent '[agent-name]' will be unavailable."
- **Recovery**: Continue with available agents, log missing agent
- **Fallback**: Suggest alternative agents with similar capabilities

### 2. Agent Operation Errors

**Agent Activation Failures**
- **Error**: Unable to load or activate requested agent
- **Message**: "Unable to activate agent '[agent-name]'. The agent may be temporarily unavailable or misconfigured."
- **Recovery**: Suggest alternative agents or retry activation
- **Fallback**: Continue with current agent or return to orchestrator

**Task Execution Errors**
- **Error**: Agent task fails to execute properly
- **Message**: "Task '[task-name]' encountered an error during execution. Please review the task requirements and try again."
- **Recovery**: Provide specific error details and suggested corrections
- **Fallback**: Offer alternative tasks or manual completion guidance

**Resource Loading Errors**
- **Error**: Templates, checklists, or other resources unavailable
- **Message**: "Required resource '[resource-name]' is unavailable. Task execution may be limited."
- **Recovery**: Continue with available resources, note limitations
- **Fallback**: Provide generic alternatives or manual guidance

### 3. Workflow Errors

**Mode Selection Errors**
- **Error**: Invalid mode selection or mode switching failure
- **Message**: "Invalid workflow mode selected. Please choose '1' for Documentation Mode or '2' for Full Development Mode."
- **Recovery**: Re-present mode selection menu with clear instructions
- **Fallback**: Default to Documentation Mode if no valid selection

**Workflow Execution Errors**
- **Error**: Workflow fails to complete successfully
- **Message**: "Workflow '[workflow-name]' encountered an error. Progress has been saved and you can resume from the last successful step."
- **Recovery**: Provide checkpoint recovery and resume options
- **Fallback**: Offer manual completion guidance or alternative workflows

**Agent Collaboration Errors**
- **Error**: Multi-agent collaboration fails
- **Message**: "Agent collaboration encountered an issue. Switching to single-agent mode for this task."
- **Recovery**: Continue with primary agent, note collaboration limitations
- **Fallback**: Complete task with single agent and manual coordination

### 4. System Errors

**Memory or Resource Constraints**
- **Error**: System running low on resources
- **Message**: "System resources are running low. Consider simplifying the current task or restarting the session."
- **Recovery**: Suggest resource optimization or session restart
- **Fallback**: Continue with reduced functionality

**Timeout Errors**
- **Error**: Operations exceed configured timeout limits
- **Message**: "Operation timed out after [timeout] seconds. The task may be too complex or system resources may be limited."
- **Recovery**: Offer to retry with extended timeout or break into smaller tasks
- **Fallback**: Provide partial results and manual completion guidance

**Unexpected System Errors**
- **Error**: Unhandled exceptions or system failures
- **Message**: "An unexpected error occurred. The system will attempt to recover automatically. If the problem persists, please restart the session."
- **Recovery**: Attempt automatic recovery and state restoration
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to basic functionality

## Error Response Standards

### Professional Error Messages
- **Clear and Specific**: Explain exactly what went wrong and why
- **Actionable**: Provide specific steps the user can take to resolve the issue
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain business-appropriate language even in error conditions
- **Context Aware**: Include relevant context about what the user was trying to accomplish
- **Solution Oriented**: Focus on resolution rather than just problem identification

### Error Message Template
```
ðŸš¨ **[Error Type]**: [Brief Description]

**What happened**: [Detailed explanation of the error]

**Impact**: [How this affects the current task or workflow]

**Recommended actions**:
1. [Primary resolution step]
2. [Alternative resolution step]
3. [Fallback option]

**Need help?** Use `/help` for additional guidance or `/reset` to start over.
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Automatic Recovery
- **State Preservation**: Maintain user context and progress where possible
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality rather than complete failure
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly clean up resources and reset state as needed
- **Logging**: Record error details for troubleshooting and improvement

### User-Initiated Recovery
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide step-by-step recovery guidance
- **Multiple Options**: Offer several recovery paths based on user preferences
- **Progress Preservation**: Maintain as much user progress as possible
- **Validation**: Confirm recovery success before continuing

### System Recovery
- **Health Checks**: Perform system health validation after recovery
- **Configuration Reload**: Refresh configuration and agent definitions
- **Resource Verification**: Ensure all required resources are available
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor system performance post-recovery

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Automatic Handling
- Simple configuration errors
- Missing optional resources
- Temporary resource constraints
- Basic validation failures

### Level 2: User Intervention Required
- Invalid user input or selections
- Missing required configuration files
- Agent activation failures
- Workflow execution errors

### Level 3: System Administrator Required
- Persistent configuration issues
- System resource exhaustion
- Security or permission errors
- Corrupted system files

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Error Tracking
- **Error Frequency**: Monitor error occurrence rates and patterns
- **Error Types**: Track most common error categories
- **Recovery Success**: Measure automatic recovery effectiveness
- **User Impact**: Assess error impact on user experience

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Times**: Monitor error handling response times
- **Resource Usage**: Track resource consumption during error conditions
- **System Health**: Continuous monitoring of system health indicators
- **User Satisfaction**: Collect feedback on error handling effectiveness

## Best Practices

### Prevention
- **Validation**: Implement comprehensive input and configuration validation
- **Testing**: Regular testing of error conditions and recovery procedures
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of error handling procedures
- **Training**: Ensure users understand common error scenarios and resolutions

### Response
- **Speed**: Respond to errors quickly and efficiently
- **Clarity**: Provide clear, understandable error messages
- **Consistency**: Use consistent error handling patterns across the system
- **Learning**: Use error patterns to improve system design and user experience
