When using Documentation Mode, agents collaborate to produce:

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
   - Complete product specifications
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Success metrics

2. **Architecture Document**
   - System design and components
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Integration specifications
   - Implementation approach

3. **Checklist Document**
   - Development acceptance criteria
   - Implementation steps
   - Quality assurance checkpoints
   - Definition of done

#### Collaborative Process

## üéØ Maximizing Agent Effectiveness

### Providing Context

#### Effective Context Examples
```
‚ùå Poor Context:
"Create a PRD for an app"

‚úÖ Rich Context:
"Create a PRD for a mobile fitness tracking app targeting busy professionals aged 25-40. The app should integrate with wearable devices and provide personalized workout recommendations. Key competitors include MyFitnessPal and Strava."
```

#### Context Categories
