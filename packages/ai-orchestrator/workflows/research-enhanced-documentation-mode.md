## Enhanced Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Research Planning (5-10 minutes)

**Orchestrator Actions:**
1. **Analyze User Request** - Determine research requirements based on project scope
2. **Agent Assignment** - Assign appropriate agents based on project needs
3. **Research Strategy** - Define research methodology and focus areas for each agent
4. **Resource Allocation** - Set research budgets and time limits

**Agent Research Assignments:**
- **Product Manager (John)**: Market analysis, competitive research, user research
- **Technical Architect (Fred)**: Technology evaluation, architecture patterns, security research
- **Platform Engineer (Alex)**: Infrastructure research, cost optimization, compliance analysis

2. **Insight Integration** - Combine insights from different research perspectives
3. **Evidence Validation** - Cross-validate findings across multiple sources
4. **Gap Identification** - Identify areas needing additional research
5. **Consensus Building** - Resolve conflicting research findings

**Synthesis Outputs:**
- **Integrated Market Intelligence** - Combined market, competitive, and user insights
- **Technical Feasibility Assessment** - Technology and architecture recommendations
- **Implementation Roadmap** - Infrastructure and operational considerations

### Phase 4: Collaborative Document Generation (20-30 minutes)
