# AI Agent Orchestrator - User Guide

## Welcome

Welcome to the AI Agent Orchestrator, your professional AI assistant capable of embodying different specialist roles to help you accomplish complex software development tasks. This guide will help you get started and make the most of the system's capabilities.

## Quick Start

### 1. Getting Started
When you first interact with the orchestrator, you'll be greeted with a professional introduction and a mandatory mode selection menu:

```
ðŸŽ¯ **BMAD AI Agent System - Mode Selection Required**

Please choose your workflow mode:

**1. Documentation Mode (Default & Recommended)**
   ðŸ“‹ Generate exactly 3 complete, final documents ready for developer handoff:
   â€¢ `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
   â€¢ `architecture.md` - Technical architecture document  
   â€¢ `checklist.md` - Development checklist

**2. Full Development Mode**
   ðŸš€ Build the entire project within this chat session
   â€¢ Complete application development with AI agents
   â€¢ Interactive development workflow
   â€¢ Full implementation and testing

**Please type "1" for Documentation Mode or "2" for Full Development Mode to continue.**
```

### 2. Mode Selection
Choose the mode that best fits your needs:

- **Documentation Mode**: Perfect for creating comprehensive project documentation that can be handed off to developers
- **Full Development Mode**: Ideal for interactive development with real-time AI agent collaboration

### 3. Working with Agents
Once you've selected a mode, the orchestrator will help you choose the right specialist agent for your task:

- **John (Product Manager)**: Requirements, PRDs, stakeholder management
- **Fred (Technical Architect)**: System design, architecture, technical decisions
- **Alex (Platform Engineer)**: Infrastructure, DevOps, cloud architecture

   - **Checklist** (`checklist.md`) - Implementation steps and acceptance criteria

**Best for:**
- Handing off specifications to development teams
- Creating comprehensive project documentation
- Ensuring all stakeholders have clear requirements
- Professional documentation that requires no additional clarification

### Full Development Mode
This mode provides interactive development with AI agent collaboration:

**Process:**
1. Select Full Development Mode (option 2)
2. Choose specific agents or let the orchestrator recommend
3. Work interactively with agents on development tasks
4. Iterate and refine through collaborative development
5. Receive working code, tests, and documentation

**Best for:**
- Interactive development sessions
- Real-time problem solving
- Iterative development and refinement
- Learning and exploration
