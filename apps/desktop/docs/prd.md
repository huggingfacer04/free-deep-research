# Free Deep Research System with Advanced API Management - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Democratize access to sophisticated deep research capabilities by eliminating cost barriers while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability
- Create a unified research platform combining proven methodologies with advanced API management and professional user experience
- Deliver cross-platform desktop application with sub-5-second performance and 95% rate limit accuracy
- Establish secure, encrypted data management with automatic backup and recovery capabilities
- Integrate seamlessly with BMAD methodology workflow for enhanced development team productivity
- Provide extensible architecture supporting future service integrations and advanced research methodologies

### Background Context

The current deep research landscape presents a significant gap between expensive commercial solutions ($200+ monthly) and basic free alternatives lacking enterprise features. Existing solutions like OpenAI's Deep Research and Google's Gemini plans provide valuable capabilities but create cost barriers for researchers, students, and small organizations. Meanwhile, available free alternatives lack professional interfaces, robust API management, and enterprise-level reliability.

Our analysis of Don Lim's cost-optimized methodology and Nick Scamara's professional interface approach reveals complementary strengths that, when unified, can deliver a comprehensive solution. The Free Deep Research System addresses this market gap by combining multiple proven research methodologies with enterprise-grade API management, all operating within free service tiers while delivering professional-level user experience and reliability.
